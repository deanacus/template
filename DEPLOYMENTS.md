# Deployments

Describe the deployment process in depth here if required, rather than the
README, as the purpose of the README is to provide developers a short overview
rather than form comprehensive documentation.

For projects that have a number of different deployment options or steps, it may
be worthwhile documenting these on Confluence and providing a link here.
